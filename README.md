# CPGM230 Test 1

## C++ Program to track college enrollment

Your objective for this project is to create a program which uses a 2-dimensional array. The program should accept data for college enrollment. You should create your program to accept these data for 3 years and each year should collect enrollment for 3 semesters (Fall, Spring, Summer).  Thus, you will need a 3x3 array.

Your program should capture data entered by the user for Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3 by entering the number of students enrolled for Semester 1, Semester 2, and Semester 3.

After these data have been entered the array should be passed to a VOID function and display the results. Also calculate and display the total number of students enrolled over the three year period.

Compress the completed program and submit to Canvas. There is a two hour time limit.
